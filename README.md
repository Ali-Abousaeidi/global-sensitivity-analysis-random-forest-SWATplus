## Study Overview

This study applies a Random Forest-based surrogate model to perform Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) on the SWAT+ model. The GSA identifies and ranks the most influential input variables for simulating river flow and sediment load in the Simiyu River Basin, Tanzania.

Key features of the study:
- **Case Study**: Simiyu River Basin, located in Southeast Lake Victoria, Tanzania.
- **Data Period**: January 1, 1952 â€“ December 1, 2019 (monthly resolution).
- **Key Methods**:
  - Permutation Variable Importance (PVI) measures.
  - Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs).
